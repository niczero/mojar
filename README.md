# Mojar

A small booster pack for Mojolicious focused on integration.
The (soft) criteria are
*   Filesystem footprint kept small.
*   Number of package dependencies kept low.
*   XS files avoided where practical.
*   Non-linux platforms (incl Strawberry Perl) supported where practical.

## Features

*   Mojar::Cache

    A bare-bones cache.  Aims to be sufficient for everyday use while providing
an easy upgrade path to CHI when better performance or richer functionality is
required.

*   Mojar::Util

    A small set of utility functions.
